# 🗼 Tokyo High-Income Workforce Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This dashboard performs a deep-dive micro-analysis of the economic elite in Tokyo. Focusing exclusively on the **High-Income bracket (>¥10 Million annually)**, the analysis challenges the assumption that "Management" is the only path to wealth in the capital.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights

### 1. The "Engineering" Dominance
* **Top Profession:** **Engineering** is the single largest high-income profession, accounting for **33%** of all earners making over ¥10M.
* **Challenging Assumptions:** The data reveals that technical roles (Engineering) and corporate support roles (Clerical) often out-earn traditional "Admin/Managerial" roles in aggregate volume.

### 2. The ">15 Million Yen" Shift
The composition of wealth changes drastically as income rises to the ultra-wealthy bracket (>¥15M):
* **Clerical Dominance:** Surprisingly, **Clerical** roles (likely Corporate Headquarters / Senior Specialists) make up the largest share of the >15M bracket at **30.4%**.
* **Engineering:** Follows closely at **23.7%**.
* **Management:** "Admin Managerial" roles account for **15.5%**, placing them third behind technical and corporate specialist roles.

### 3. Income Stratification
* **10M - 12.5M Tier:** Heavily populated by **Engineering (36.9%)**, indicating a high ceiling for technical contributors.
* **Sales:** Remains a consistent but smaller contributor to the high-income pool (approx 8-16% depending on the bracket).
